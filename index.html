Information obtained from Google Calendar or Google Docs is used solely to provide or improve user-facing features visible within our application and is not transferred to others unless necessary for providing these features, complying with law, or as part of a merger/acquisition.</p>


    <h2>4. Data Sharing & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information. We share information only as described below and work with trusted third-party service providers under strict confidentiality terms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google APIs (Calendar & Docs):</strong> If you choose to connect your Google account, our application requests authorization (via Google's standard OAuth process) to access specific data from Google Calendar and/or Google Docs APIs based on the permissions you grant. This data is used solely to provide the integrated features described in Section 3 (e.g., displaying calendar events, enabling Docs import/export) within our app. We only request the minimum necessary permissions. This data is handled according to Google's API Services User Data Policy. You can manage or revoke access via your Google account settings at any time. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Cloud Firebase:</strong> Used for backend infrastructure, including user authentication, secure data storage (audio files, transcripts, user data), and database management. Your data is stored within Google Cloud's secure environment. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Cloud Privacy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>AssemblyAI:</strong> Our primary provider for audio transcription. We provide AssemblyAI with access to your audio files (via secure URLs hosted on Firebase) solely for the purpose of generating transcriptions, speaker labels, and timestamps. <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">AssemblyAI Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Used to process transcription text to generate helpful content like titles, summaries, and action items. We may send transcript text to OpenAI's API for this purpose. We encourage you to review their policies regarding API data usage. <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies" target="_blank">OpenAI API Data Usage Policies</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Brevo:</strong> Our email service provider. When you share content via email or use automated email features, we provide Brevo with recipient email addresses, subject lines, and email content (which might include generated notes or transcripts, possibly as PDF attachments) to facilitate delivery. <a href="https://www.brevo.com/legal/privacypolicy/" target="_blank">Brevo Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> We use third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, Apple App Store In-App Purchases) to handle transactions. Your payment information is provided directly to them, and their use of your information is governed by their privacy policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Wisp, our users, or others.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to standard confidentiality arrangements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or loss. These measures include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Utilizing secure cloud infrastructure provided by Google Cloud Firebase.</li>
        <li>Implementing access controls to limit data access to authorized personnel.</li>
        <li>Encrypting sensitive data where appropriate.</li>
        <li>Adhering to secure protocols (like OAuth) for accessing third-party data like Google Calendar and Docs.</li>
        <li>Providing users with controls to manage, edit, or delete their data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also rely on the security practices of our third-party providers (Google, AssemblyAI, OpenAI, Brevo). However, please be aware that no security measure is 100% impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have the following rights regarding your personal data, subject to applicable law:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request access to the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Request correction of any inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request deletion of your personal data and content stored in your account, subject to legal or operational retention needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Control Third-Party Access:</strong> You can manage or revoke our access to your Google account data (Calendar, Docs) at any time directly through your Google account security settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> Manage cookie preferences through your browser settings and opt out of non-essential marketing communications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights or inquire about your data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@descriptai.online">support@descriptai.online</a>.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with our services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Data accessed via Google APIs (Calendar, Docs) is generally not stored persistently by us, except potentially temporarily cached for performance or when explicitly saved by you within our application (e.g., linking a note to a calendar event). When data is no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it. Note that data processed by third-party services may be subject to their own retention policies.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>Our service may contain links to third-party websites or services (including the privacy policies linked in Section 4). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, service offerings, or relevant regulations. We will post any changes on this page and update the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
